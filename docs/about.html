<p>
    A horror text-based adventure game made using OpenAI's GPT-3 (Davinci model) API.
</p>
<h2>
    Why
</h2>
<p>
    It's an homage to old-school text based adventure games, and an exploration of AI's ability to write an emotionally compelling story for the player.
</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>
    The app sends a prompt to Davinci to write a text-based adventure game that will give players choices numbered 1-3. When a choice is made, it is added back to the entire story and sent as a prompt to Davinci to send more choices, until the story is finished.
</p>
<p>
    The story changes every time it is run, and it is generated live during gameplay. Ony Davinci has control over the choices and when to end the game.
</p>
<p>
    The pace of the text also increases the longer the player plays.
</p>
<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    It's interesting how Davinci is able to create a cohesive story that follows the theme of a horror adventure game. The stories Davinci generates usually consists of one spooky figure in a strange place, and the player is given choices to confront the figure or run away.
</p>
<p>
    Somehow, the story always ends in about 5 minutes or so, and Davinci almost always gives a somewhat optimistic ending.
